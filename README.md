# Gomoku

#### Final Score 125/100

## Challenge

Create a Gomoku game GUI, with an AI player.

[Gomoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) is a strategy board game traditionally played on a Go board with black and white stones.
Two players take turns placing their stones on an intersection of the 19x19 board.
A player wins by aligning 5 or more stones.

#### Challenge Requirements:

* AI uses Minimiax algorithm
* Timer: AI must move within 0.5 seconds
* Human vs AI
* Human vs Human
* Human vs Hotseat (AI suggests move, human chooses)

## Getting Started

First you need to have your golang workspace set up on your machine.
Then clone this repo into your go-workspace/src/ folder with ```git clone https://github.com/anyashuka/Gomoku.git```

Move into Gomoku folder then download dependencies with ```go get -d ./...```

Finally, to run, go run main.go directly:
```go run main.go```

Alternatively build and run the binary:
```go build; ./Gomoku```

## Additional Rules

#### Capture

You can remove a pair of your opponentâ€™s stones by flanking them. In the following scenario, by playing in a, Blue captures the red pair and removes the stones from the game. One can only capture PAIRS, not 1 or >2 stones in a row.

#### Capture 10

If you capture ten stones, you win.

#### Game-ending capture

A player that aligns 5 stones only wins if the opponent can not break this alignment by capturing, or win by capturing 10.

#### No Double-threes

A free-three is an alignement of three stones that, if not immediately blocked, allows for an indefendable alignment of four stones (an alignment of four stones with two unobstructed extremities). Both of these scenarios are free-threes:

A double-three is a move that introduces two simultaneous free-three alignments. This is an indefendable scenario.

In the following scenario, by playing in a, Red would introduce a double-three, therefore this is a forbidden move. However, if there were a blue stone in b, one of the three-aligned would be obstructed, therefore the move in a would be legal. Furthermore, it is not forbidden to introduce a double-three by capturing a pair.

## Approach

Written in Golang for speed and elegance.

### Heuristic

```aiPriority.go``` contains values for each alignment, capture and win. Alignments are checked for freedom to expand, vs flanked.

<img src="https://github.com/anyashuka/Gomoku/blob/master/img/aiPriority.png" width="40%">

For any considered move the sum of values is calculated.

Dealing with multiple depths:
+ If considering the players move, add the value of that move.
- If considering the opponents move, minus the value of that move.

Divide the value added/subtracted by the depth. This solves the problem of needing to be defensive (valuing blocking an opponents free-three more than placing ones own free-three, failure to do so will lose the game), while simultanously overcoming this pessimistic viewpoint (whats the point of me attacking if they are probably then going to defend, and defending is worth more).

### Optimization

The goban is represented efficiently by a (19 x 19) 2D array of positions, each position made of 2 bools (2 bits) occupied and player.

The high branching factor of this problem makes it difficult to reach a deep enough depth for an intelligent AI while returning suggested moves within a short enough time. There are several ways in which we can reduce branching:

#### Alpha beta pruning

#### Threat space

A threat space of of 4 spaces around the last two moves reduces the search space. In the following example, everything within the two red squares is within the threat space, and so is considered for the next move.

On my system, with the default threatspace of 4, an AI depth of 4 is possible in under 0.5 seconds. A depth of 10 is possible by reducing the threat space to 1, not that this makes a better AI player.

#### hasNeigbours()

Branching can be further reduced by excluding all moves which do not have have immediate neighbours, i.e. unconnected to anything. In the following example, everything within the two red squares has an immediate neighbour, and so is considered for the next move.

## More Examples

### Hotseat

The AI suggests a move with a pulsing stone, but a human player must choose (click).

### Doge mode

Press key d, or the hidden doge mode button in the new game screen.

## Dependencies

Thankfully, running ```go get -d ./...``` should take care of all dependencies for you.

#### Ebiten

The GUI uses [Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten), a dead simple open source 2D game library for Go.
