#### TO DO ####
	- take current captured stones into account ?
	- take past Player actions into account to identify patterns and weigh board states accordingly ?

	- prioritize align 5 over capture
	- prioritize block 4 over block 3
	- if opponent aligns 5, prioritize capture over everything else (also prioritize break5 over other captures)

	- w-www-	->	w-wwwb	should be	wbwww-
	- var to const? e.g. row

#### BONUS ####
1. Human vs human, hotseat vs hotseat, ai vs ai
2. Highlight Last Move, Win Move, & Captured
3. Tips - show possible captures, & align 5
4. Undo button
5. GO intro
6. Artificial Idiot - AI depth 0
7. key press f enter/exit Fullscreen

- display value for position?

#### CORRECTION ####
 - "Improved" Minimax implementation (Alpha-beta pruning, negascout, mtdf, ...) -> 5 points!
 - Move search Depth - 10 or more levels -> 5 points!
 - search space of the algo - Multiple rectangular windows emcompassing placed stones but minimizing wasted space -> 5

 - Heuristic
	- take current alignments into account ?
	- check whether an alignment has enough space to develop into a 5-in-a-row ?
	- weigh an alignment according to its freedom (Free, half-free, flanked) ?

	- check for advanteageous combinations ?
	- take both Players into account ?


	- take potential captures into account ?
	- take current captured stones into account ?
	- take past Player actions into account to identify patterns and weigh board states accordingly ?
