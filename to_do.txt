#### TO DO ####
	- take current captured stones into account ?
	- take past Player actions into account to identify patterns and weigh board states accordingly ?
	
	- seperate struct for efficiency? (only things ai needs)

#### BONUS ####
1. Human vs human, hotseat vs hotseat, ai vs ai
2. Undo button
3. Tips
4. Highlight Last Move
5. Highlight Win Move
6. Highlight Captured
7. GO intro
8. key press f enter/exit Fullscreen

- display value for position?

#### CORRECTION ####
 - "Improved" Minimax implementation (Alpha-beta pruning, negascout, mtdf, ...) -> 5 points!
 - Move search Depth - 10 or more levels -> 5 points!
 - search space of the algo - Multiple rectangular windows emcompassing placed stones but minimizing wasted space -> 5

 - Heuristic
	- take current alignments into account ?
	- check whether an alignment has enough space to develop into a 5-in-a-row ?
	- weigh an alignment according to its freedom (Free, half-free, flanked) ?

	- check for advanteageous combinations ?
	- take both Players into account ?


	- take potential captures into account ?
	- take current captured stones into account ?
	- take past Player actions into account to identify patterns and weigh board states accordingly ?
