#### TO DO ####
	- take potential captures into account ?
	- take current captured stones into account ?
	- take past Player actions into account to identify patterns and weigh board states accordingly ?
	
	- seperate struct for efficiency? (only things ai needs)

#### BONUS ####
1. Human vs human, hotseat vs hotseat, ai vs ai
2. highlight last move
3. highlight Win move
4. highlight captured
5. GO intro

- undo move button?
- display value for position?

	- align 5
	- can capture
	- can be captured?

 - "Improved" Minimax implementation (Alpha-beta pruning, negascout, mtdf, ...) -> 5 points!
 - Move search Depth - 10 or more levels -> 5 points!
 - search space of the algo - Multiple rectangular windows emcompassing placed stones but minimizing wasted space -> 5

 - Heuristic
	- take current alignments into account ?
	- check whether an alignment has enough space to develop into a 5-in-a-row ?
	- weigh an alignment according to its freedom (Free, half-free, flanked) ?
	- take potential captures into account ?
	- take current captured stones into account ?
	- check for advanteageous combinations ?
	- take both Players into account ?
